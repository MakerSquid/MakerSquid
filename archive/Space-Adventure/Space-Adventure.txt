A planetary location-based adventure game.  Start on a single planet, when you've done everything there, you have aquired a space ship and can adventure to other planets.  The point is not to adventure in space (perhaps eventually) but basically a turn based adventure game with flexibility to do anything that a particular planet has to offer.

There are multiple locations within a planet.
