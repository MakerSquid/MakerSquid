# Introduction
Automates getting bing points.

# Getting Started
Get the code.

Build the code.

Edit the app.config. provide your user name and password, need to NOT check that in.  I mistakenly do it from time to time.

# Build and Test
Run it in debug mode since it's not working yet.

The method that returns the bing summary page needs to be fixed, it is still using outdated info.

Also, all the keys and whether it's by name or by id should be in the config file, but I was always too lazy
